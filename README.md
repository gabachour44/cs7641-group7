# I. Introduction
CFD too complicated to use, use ML to curtail time to determine optimal airfoil properties.
In essence, for a given parsecc parameter range, we can predict the range of lift and drag and then group thes data into classes based on these ranges. 


Introduce Gabriel's paper, Martin's paper, what has been done in the past.

Morphing wing aircraft are flight vehicles which are able to alter their geometric configurations to interact with their environments in an optimal fashion.

# II. Problem Statement 
Introduce lift and drag. Why in particular we are interested in the optimization techniques that we are. So, reducing drag will be commensurate with savings on fuel for a given flight mission, etc. 
Look at lift, drag, moment and volume. We investigate the volume as a parameter due to its role in the structural and fuel storage considerations of the wing. In particular, the airfoil section must have sufficient thickness to withstand the various aerodynamic loads imparted to the section. Additionally, there need be enough space for fuel storage.



# III. Data Collection
UIUC Airfoil Database for the data set. Wish to determine a correlation between PARSEC parameters and our categories of interest.
Run data in XFOIL. 

# IV. Methods
Clustering and Beta-CV.
